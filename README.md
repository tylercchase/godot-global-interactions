# godot-global-interactions
A Godot project that uses the idea of a general texture map to correlate to the world centered around a player. The texture shows the different objects around a player and how they should be displaced 

## An example of the texture that gets mapped to the grass around the player

## There is also a trail system implemented in a classic stack approach that uses a value for a constant reduction of the impact of each piece of the trail
